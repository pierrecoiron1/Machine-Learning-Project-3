# Machine-Learning-Project-3
This is a "neural network from scratch", intended only as a proof of concept.

The pdf labeled "project 3" was the original rubric.
Note that the project was intended strictly as a proof of concept, and was not intended to be fully tuned.

With a single hidden layer network, there are 3 hidden layers:

1. The Number of training iterations
2. The Number of Nodes in the hidden layer
3. The Learning Rate

Unfortunatly, after several hours of tuning my 3 superparameters, I could never find a model that was very accuurate.
However, just like the rubic asked for, I proved the concept of a single-hidden layered nueral network.
Obtaining a more accurate model is simply a matter of continued tuning.

Given more time on this project and a larger scope, I beleive it could be possible to automate the tuning.
Thought my time tuning, I noticed some patters.
For example, when the learning rate became VERY low, the predicted output would become a daigonal plane.
